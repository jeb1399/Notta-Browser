# HELLO!!!

Hello and welcome this is my proxy, it should look like a browser and should have a familiar feel to it since I tried my best to style it as a browser.

# SETUP

First install git and node.js install: `sudo apt install nodejs` or install node.js in any way you can on your system. clone: then clone this repo if you havent already `git clone https://github.com/jeb1399/Unblocker-Browser.git`



Install dependencies `npm install -y`



**(OPTIONAL)**: `npm audit fix`



**(OPTIONAL)**: If you want to keep your server up *24/7* then first install pm2 by running `sudo npm install pm2 -g` **(MUST RUN WITH SUDO)** then run `npm start app.js --name "UB-Browser"` then for it to run on startup run `pm2 startup` then save `pm2 save` if you cant save and it tells you it needs to force the save you may need to run `pm2 save --force` or `sudo pm2 save --force` for it to force the changes and force sync.



**(OPTIONAL)**: If you want to run it once or for testing run `node app.js` (Sometimes it may break and you may need to perform every command again with `sudo`)
